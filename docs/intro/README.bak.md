# Introduction to Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library which produces publication quality
figures in a variety of hardcopy formats and interactive environments across
platforms. Matplotlib can be used in Python scripts, the Python and [IPython](http://ipython.org)
shells, the [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org) notebook, web application servers, and four graphical user
interface toolkits.

Matplotlib tries to make easy things easy and hard things possible. You
can generate plots, histograms, power spectra, bar charts, errorcharts,
scatterplots, etc., with just a few lines of code. For examples, see the
[sample plots](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/sample_plots.html) and [thumbnail gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html).

For simple plotting the ``pyplot`` module provides a MATLAB-like interface,
particularly when combined with IPython. For the power user, you have full
control of line styles, font properties, axes properties, etc, via an object
oriented interface or via a set of functions familiar to MATLAB users.

# Installation

Visit the [Matplotlib installation instructions](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html).

# Documentation

This is the documentation for Matplotlib version 3.1.1.

To get started, read the [User's Guide](https://matplotlib.org/users/index.html).

Other versions are available:

- [3.1.1](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/index.html) Stable version.
- [2.2.4 LTS](https://matplotlib.org/2.2.4/index.html) LTS version.
- [3.2.x](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/index.html) Latest git master (unstable)
- [3.0.3](https://matplotlib.org/3.0.3/index.html) Older stable version.

Trying to learn how to do a particular kind of plot? Check out the
[examples gallery](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html) or the [list of plotting commands](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_summary.html).

## Other learning resources

There are many [external learning resources](https://matplotlib.org/resources/index.html) available
including printed material, videos and tutorials.

## Need help?

Matplotlib is a welcoming, inclusive project, and we follow the [Python Software Foundation Code of Conduct](http://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/) in everything we do.

Check the [FAQ](faq/index.html) and the [API](api/index.html) docs.

For help, join the [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib) and the [matplotlib-users](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users),
[matplotlib-devel](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel), and [matplotlib-announce](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-announce) mailing lists, or check out the
Matplotlib tag on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib). The [search](search.html) tool searches
all of the documentation, including full text search of over 350 complete
examples which exercise almost every corner of Matplotlib.

You can file bugs, patches and feature requests on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues), but it
is a good idea to ping us on the mailing list too.

To keep up to date with what's going on in Matplotlib, see the [what's new](users/whats_new.html) page or browse the [source code](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib). Anything that could
require changes to your existing code is logged in the [API changes](api/api_changes.html) file.

### Toolkits

Matplotlib ships with several add-on [toolkits](api/toolkits/index.html),
including 3d plotting with ``mplot3d``, axes helpers in ``axes_grid1`` and axis
helpers in ``axisartist``.

### Third party packages

A large number of [third party packages](thirdpartypackages/index.html)
extend and build on Matplotlib functionality, including several higher-level
plotting interfaces ([seaborn](https://seaborn.github.io/), [holoviews](http://holoviews.org), [ggplot](http://ggplot.yhathq.com), ...), and two projection
and mapping toolkits ([basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap) and [cartopy](http://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest)).

### Citing Matplotlib

Matplotlib is the brainchild of John Hunter (1968-2012), who, along with its
many contributors, have put an immeasurable amount of time and effort into
producing a piece of software utilized by thousands of scientists worldwide.

If Matplotlib contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication,
please acknowledge this work by citing the project. A [ready-made citation entry](citing.html) is available.

### Open source

Matplotlib is a Sponsored Project of NumFOCUS, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
charity in the United States. NumFOCUS provides Matplotlib with
fiscal, legal, and administrative support to help ensure the health
and sustainability of the project. Visit [numfocus.org](nf) for more
