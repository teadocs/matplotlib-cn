    <h2>Why choose Matplotlib?</h2>
    <p>If you find yourself learning Matplotlib one day, it is probably because: 1. Matplotlib is a very powerful Python drawing tool; 2. There is a lot of data in hand, but I don't know how to present it.

### As Easy as 1, 2, 3

# 3、Draw a scatter plot using matplotlib's scatter method
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> y = [2.3, 3.4, 1.2, 6.6, 7.0]
>>> plt.scatter(x, y, color='r', marker='+')

# 4、Output result
# Your computer will then pop up a window with the final chart effect.
